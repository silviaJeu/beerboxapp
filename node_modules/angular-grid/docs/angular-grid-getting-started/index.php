    <h2>Getting Started</h2>

    <h4>Dependencies</h4>

    <p>
        In your html, include AngularJS (1.2 or later) and AngularGrid (download from <a href="../dist">here</a>).
    </p>

    <p>
        If you want non-minified versions, you need to include: angularGrid.js, angularGrid.css, theme-fresh.css
        (optional if you want bundled fresh theme) and theme-dark.css (optional if you want bundled dark theme).
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want minified versions, download the equivalent '.min' files of the same names.
    </p>

    <p>
        AngularGrid has no other dependencies except AngularJS.
    </p>

    <h4>Creating the Angular Module</h4>
    While creating your Angular module, include AngularGrid as a dependency of your module. Eg:
    <p/>
    <pre><code>var module = angular.module("example", <b>["angularGrid"]</b>);</code></pre>

    <h4>Angular Grid Div</h4>

    To include a grid in your html, add the AngularGrid attribute to a div. The value
    of the div should be the provided grid options on the scope.

    <p/>
    It is also usual (although not neccessary) to provide a styling theme to
    the grid. Two themes come with the grid, ag-fresh and ag-dark. Each one is
    set by applying the corresponding class of the same name to the div. In the
    example, ag-fresh is used.

    <h4>Grid Options</h4>
    The grid options provide AngularGrid with the details needed to render. At a
    minimum you provide the columns (columnDefs) and the rows (rowData).

    <show-example example="example1" example-height="200px"></show-example>
</div>
